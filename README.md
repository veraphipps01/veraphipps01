### Hi! I'm Vera Phipps 

I am a full stack software engineer in training with MIT xPro, with a background is in finance and investment banking. I'm enthusiastic about creating dynamic and interactive applications and evolving them to fit the needs and wants of the users. 
Iâ€™m interested in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, neural nets, so my next planed step would be learning Python.
